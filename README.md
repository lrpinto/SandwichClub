# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Tasks
Built a layout and populated its fields from data received as JSON.

## Learned
- How to submit projects for review
- JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## How Do I Completed this Project?
Downloaded the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

Designed the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
displayed in a sensible way. Implemented the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that I designed.
